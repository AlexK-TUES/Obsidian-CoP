# Obsidian-CoP
Obsidian Colaboration Plugin (CoP) is a plugin to get real time colaboration on wifi inspired by google docks and multy-people github sync on the shared vault.
## This repo is for code development only! You need the plugin (currently not done) and a seperate repo for the shared project to be stored at!
